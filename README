Put this together for those days when I need a light background in gvim instead
of a dark (in which case I usually use zenburn).  This syntax has the following
attributes:

- Soft and easy on the eyes, but enough contrast
- No italics or bold text because I sometimes get rendering issues
- Nice colors - evenly balanced
- Colors for all main syntax items! (pet-peeve- otherwise great colorschemes
  that combine syntactic elements into the same color)

I used proton.vim as a starting template (hence the name)- but I don't think
there's much of proton left in neutron.
